# Holi: A Holistic Pipeline for Ancient Metagenomics

Holi is a versatile bioinformatic pipeline designed for the analysis of ancient metagenomic data. It integrates tools for processing raw sequence reads, taxonomic classification, authenticity assessment, and results visualization, making it a solution for researchers working with ancient eDNA (aeDNA) and more specifically interested in the eukaryotes.

With a focus on the challenges unique to ancient metagenomics, such as low-quality and damaged DNA, Holi attempts accurate identification of taxa using a competitive setup, authentication of ancient DNA patterns, genome/reference-wide statistics and metrics for eventual reporting.


Below you can find both a bash script guide for running the pipeline and a slurm sbash version of the same. For the details and explanations please visit the wiki.
